# PocketMenMove
This is a game that is a bit like pokemon but simpler and only using the linux terminal to run the GUI.

Though there are better and more efficent ways to make games this process taught me a lot about how the linux terminal shows data, how inputs are read by the OS, and how I could store and manimulate data to run a program.

Below are pictures of the game in action - more can be found here [Gameplay](https://github.com/wilmotha/PocketMenMove/tree/master/game_play_photos "Gameplay Photos")
