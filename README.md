# PocketMenMove
This is a game that is a bit like pokemon but simpler and only using the linux terminal to run the GUI.

Though there are better and more efficent ways to make games this process taught me a lot about how the linux terminal shows data, how inputs are read by the OS, and how I could store and manimulate data to run a program.

## Run
Clone the project and use the make file provided. It only works on linux/unix, and will not work with linux subsystem for windows. MacOS is untested.

## Pictures
